### 🚀How to run?


```
$ cat domains.txt
  
example.com
example2.com
example3.com
example4.com 
example5.com

$ ./whysobroke domains.txt

[*] NOERROR             : example.com [ns1.example.com]
[*] SERVFAIL RECORD     : example2.com [ns100.example.com]
[+] PROBABLY VULNERABLE : example3.com [brokenserver.example.com] 
[*] NXDOMAIN            : example4.com  
[*] CNAME               : example5.com [someotherdomain.com]   
```  

### ⭐Other features

EXAMPLE.COM
#!@!@*(EXAMPLE2.COM
example3%$-staging.com

$ ./whysobroke domains.txt

[*] NOERROR             : example.com [ns.example.com]
[*] NOERROR             : example2.com [ns.example2.com]
[+] PROBABLY VULNERABLE : example3-staging.com [brokenserver.example3-staging.com]

- If you have configured `telegram-send` then you can just uncomment last few lines from "whysobroke" script and results will be sent to your telegram. More information on how to configure telegram would be find [here](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Blogs/Productivity-Sauce/Push-Messages-from-the-Command-Line-to-Telegram).

### 📁Output

- The script saves CNAME,SERVFAIL and VULNERABLE records in cname.txt, servfail.txt and vulns.txt respectively. 
- **WARNING!** : Whenever script runs it removes existing txt files so make sure to move/rename them after each scan.

### 📌How it works? / Summary

- The script gives output in standard dns record names such as CNAME,NOERROR,SERVFAIL. 
- Checkout below flags returned by the script...

```
[+] Flags retruned by the script
---------------------------------

1. NXDOMAIN : When target domain does not exist. However, sometimes NXDOMAIN records does have CNAME record which will be scanned by the script.
~ [*] NXDOMAIN : example.com [cname.example.com]
~ [*] NXDOMAIN : example.com = when it returns result like this, it means that no such domain or CNAME records found.

2. SERVFAIL RECORD : When target domain's dns query fails. However, this script will also attempt to look for SERVFAIL target's nameservers.
~ [*] SERVFAIL RECORD : example.com [ns1.example.com.ns2.example.com.ns3.example.com.ns4.example.com]
 
3. NOERROR : When nameservers are working completely fine. 
~ [*] NOERROR : example.com   
 
4. NO NAMESERVERS : When there are no nameservers for a target domain.
~ [*] NO NAMESERVERS : test.example.com
 
5. CNAME : When target is pointed to canonical name record (CNAME)
~ [*] CNAME : example.com [example2.com]

6. [+] PROBABLY VULNERABLE  : It is returned when the nameserver fails to resolve domain.
~ [+] PROBABLY VULNERABLE : example.com [brokenserver.example.com]
